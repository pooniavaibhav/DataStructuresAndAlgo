# DataStructuresAndAlgo
Key concept and Implementation of DS and Algo. 


# Data structures can be of two types-
Primitive - These are predefined in the programming language e.g.int, float, char
Non Primitive/user defined - These are driven from combination of primitive DS.These are of two types-
## Linear - These are arraanged in sequential manner. They can be static or dynamic.
### Static - Memory location are fixed at compile time.
### Dynamic - Memory location changes.
## Non Linear - The data item is connected to many other item not in a sequential manner like tree and graph.

#Types of Algorithms-
## Simple recursive algo
## Divide and conquer algo
## Dynamic programming algo
## Greedy Algo
## Brute force algo
## Randomized algo
