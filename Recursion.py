"""
Recursion- 
A way of solving a problem by having a function calling itself.
Property-
- Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs.
- In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller.
- Base condition is needed to stop the recursion, otherwise infinite loop will occur.

Where to use-
If you can divide the problem into smaller sub problems or statement seems like -
- Design an algorithm to compute nth...
- Write code to list the n...
- Implement a method to compute all.
